## Common Issues

### Service Won't Start

**Problem**: `systemctl --user start mvwifi-auto` fails

**Check**:
```bash
# Check service status
systemctl --user status mvwifi-auto

# Check for errors in logs
journalctl --user -u mvwifi-auto --since "5 minutes ago"
```

**Common Causes**:

1. **Missing dependencies**
   ```bash
   # Check if uv is installed
   which uv
   
   # Check if python3-dbus is installed
   python3 -c "import dbus; print('OK')"
   # If fails: sudo dnf install python3-dbus
   
   # Check if requests is available
   python3 -c "import requests; print('OK')"
   ```

2. **Virtual environment issues**
   ```bash
   # Reinstall from scratch
   cd ~/DevinProjects/MVwifiAuto
   rm -rf .venv
   uv venv --system-site-packages
   uv sync
   ```

3. **Wrong ExecStart path**
   ```bash
   # Check the wrapper script exists
   cat ~/.local/bin/mvwifi-auto
   
   # Update service file if needed
   systemctl --user daemon-reload
   ```

### D-Bus Permission Errors

**Problem**: `AccessDenied: Sender is not authorized` when running as systemd user service

**Cause**: Systemd user service doesn't have D-Bus permissions to access NetworkManager

**Solution**:

**Quick workaround** (for testing):
```bash
# Stop systemd service
systemctl --user stop mvwifi-auto

# Run in user session instead (avoids permission issues)
mvwifi-auto --daemon &
```

**Proper fix** (recommended):

Create a polkit rule to allow your user to access NetworkManager:

```bash
sudo tee /etc/polkit-1/rules.d/50-mvwifi-auto.rules << 'EOF'
/* Allow mvwifi-auto user service to access NetworkManager */
polkit.addRule(function(action, subject) {
    if (action.id.indexOf("org.freedesktop.NetworkManager.") == 0 &&
        subject.user == "USERNAME") {
        return polkit.Result.YES;
    }
});
EOF
# Replace USERNAME with your actual username
```

Then reload and restart:
```bash
sudo systemctl restart polkit
systemctl --user restart mvwifi-auto
```

**Verify the fix:**
```bash
mvwifi-auto --once --verbose
# Should show: "Current state: ssid='cmvwifi', internet=True"
```

### Not Connecting to cmvwifi

**Problem**: Service running but not connecting when cmvwifi is available

**Diagnosis Steps**:

1. **Check if cmvwifi is visible**:
   ```bash
   nmcli device wifi list | grep cmvwifi
   ```

2. **Run manual test with verbose output**:
   ```bash
   cd ~/DevinProjects/MVwifiAuto
   uv run mvwifi-auto --once --verbose
   ```

3. **Check NetworkManager can connect**:
   ```bash
   # Try manual connection
   nmcli device wifi connect cmvwifi
   
   # If successful, captive portal should appear in browser
   ```

4. **Test captive portal detection**:
   ```bash
   curl -v http://detectportal.firefox.com/canonical.html
   # Should redirect if behind portal
   ```

**Common Causes**:

- **cmvwifi not in range** - Check signal strength
- **Portal detection failing** - May need to adjust detection logic
- **Connection timeout** - Increase timeout in code

### Interferes with dd-wrt Connection

**Problem**: Service disrupts existing dd-wrt connection

**Expected Behavior**: Service should NOT interfere with dd-wrt

**Verification**:
```bash
# When on dd-wrt, service should log:
# "Current state: ssid=dd-wrt, internet=True"
# And take no action

journalctl --user -u mvwifi-auto -f
```

**If interference occurs**:
1. Check decision logic in logs
2. Verify dd-wrt is in preferred networks list
3. Check if internet detection is working

### Captive Portal Not Accepted

**Problem**: Connected to cmvwifi but no internet (portal not accepted)

**Diagnosis**:

1. **Check if connected to cmvwifi**:
   ```bash
   nmcli connection show --active | grep cmvwifi
   ```

2. **Get portal host**:
   ```bash
   # The portal host is extracted from the redirect URL, not the gateway
   curl -v --max-redirs 5 http://1.1.1.1/ 2>&1 | grep "Location:"
   # Or follow redirects and check the final URL:
   curl -L -o /dev/null -w "%{url_effective}\n" http://1.1.1.1/
   ```

3. **Test portal acceptance manually**:
   ```bash
   # Extract the host from the redirect URL (e.g. 10.64.2.21:9997)
   PORTAL_HOST="10.64.2.21:9997"
   curl -X POST "http://${PORTAL_HOST}/forms/guest_toued" \
     -d "origurl=http://www.google.com" \
     -d "ok=Accept and Continue" \
     -v
   ```

4. **Check portal detection**:
   ```bash
   curl -I http://detectportal.firefox.com/canonical.html
   ```

**If manual works but auto doesn't**:
- Check logs for portal handling errors
- May need to increase delays/timeouts
- Gateway detection might be failing

### Service Stops After Suspend/Resume

**Problem**: Service doesn't resume after laptop wakes from sleep

**Check systemd configuration**:
```bash
# Check if service is still enabled
systemctl --user is-enabled mvwifi-auto

# Check last start time
systemctl --user status mvwifi-auto | grep "Active:"
```

**Solution**:
The service has `Restart=always` which should handle this. If not:

1. Check systemd user instance is running:
   ```bash
   systemctl --user status
   ```

2. Consider adding to systemd user linger:
   ```bash
   # Enable lingering (allows user services without login)
   sudo loginctl enable-linger $USER
   ```

## Debug Mode

### Enable Verbose Logging

Edit the service to add `--verbose`:
```bash
# Edit service file
systemctl --user edit mvwifi-auto

# Add to [Service] section:
# ExecStart=
# ExecStart=%h/.local/bin/mvwifi-auto --daemon --interval 60 --verbose
```

Or run manually:
```bash
cd ~/DevinProjects/MVwifiAuto
uv run mvwifi-auto --daemon --interval 30 --verbose
```

### Run Tests

```bash
cd ~/DevinProjects/MVwifiAuto

# Run all tests
uv run pytest

# Run with coverage
uv run pytest --cov=mvwifi_auto --cov-report=term-missing

# Run specific test file
uv run pytest tests/test_controller.py -v
```

### Manual Component Testing

**Test NetworkManager interface**:
```bash
python3 << 'EOF'
import sys
sys.path.insert(0, 'src')
from mvwifi_auto.network_manager import get_connection_info, find_network

# Check current connection
info = get_connection_info()
print(f"Current: {info}")

# Scan for cmvwifi
result = find_network("cmvwifi")
print(f"cmvwifi found: {result}")
EOF
```

**Test captive portal**:
```bash
python3 << 'EOF'
import sys
sys.path.insert(0, 'src')
from mvwifi_auto.captive_portal import (
    detect_captive_portal, 
    get_default_gateway,
    verify_internet_connectivity
)

# Detect portal
is_captive, redirect = detect_captive_portal()
print(f"Captive: {is_captive}, Redirect: {redirect}")

# Get gateway
gateway = get_default_gateway()
print(f"Gateway: {gateway}")

# Check internet
has_internet = verify_internet_connectivity()
print(f"Internet: {has_internet}")
EOF
```

## Android/Termux Issues

### "cmvwifi Auto Connect" profile doesn't fire

**Problem**: The profile is enabled (green dot) but never activates
when the phone is on cmvwifi.

**Cause**: Wrong or stale import. The current profile uses **WiFi
Connected** (fires instantly when Android associates to cmvwifi).
An older import may still be a WiFi Near profile, which polls scan
results — throttled by Android to roughly once per 30 minutes for
background apps — or may have broken args from an old generator bug
(an Int sent where a Str was expected became `MAC="0"`).

**Fix**: Delete the `MVwifiAuto-Termux` project in Tasker and
re-import the current XML. In the imported profile, verify it says
**WiFi Connected** with SSID `cmvwifi` — not WiFi Near.

```bash
cd ~/DevinProjects/MVwifiAuto
uv run python -m mvwifi_auto.tasker_gen --termux -o android/MVwifiAuto-Termux.prj.xml
adb push android/MVwifiAuto-Termux.prj.xml /sdcard/Tasker/projects/
```

**Verify**: Toggle WiFi off/on while connected via adb, or check
`~/storage/shared/Tasker/mvwifi_history.log` — every trigger appends
a `tasker | ConnectAndRun fired` marker.

### Connected to cmvwifi but no internet for a long time

**Problem**: The phone shows it is connected to cmvwifi, but apps
report no internet for many minutes after arriving.

**Cause**: The captive portal wasn't accepted yet — the trigger
ran late. With an old WiFi Near profile, Android's scan throttling
can delay Tasker ~30 min after the actual association. With WiFi
Connected this can't happen; it fires at association.

**Diagnose**: Check `~/storage/shared/Tasker/mvwifi_history.log`
and compare the `tasker | ConnectAndRun fired` timestamp with when
the phone actually connected (Settings → WiFi, or logcat). A large
gap means a stale WiFi Near import.

**Fix**: Same as above — re-import the current XML so the profile
is WiFi Connected.

### Phone takes 15-30 minutes to join cmvwifi

**Problem**: The phone sits in range of cmvwifi but doesn't
associate for a long time, even though auto-connect is on. Once it
does join, portal handling completes in seconds.

**Cause**: Android's network selector, not Tasker/Termux. Every
cmvwifi join initially fails Android's captive-portal validation
("no internet"), and historical DHCP/association failures further
poison its score — check `su -c 'cmd wifi list-networks'` or
`dumpsys wifi` for `CMD_UNWANTED_NETWORK`,
`numConsecutiveConnectionFailure`, and BSSID blocklist entries.
Screen-off PNO scans are throttled on top of that.

**Fix**: The `cmvwifi Periodic Nudge` Time profile (every 15 min,
requires root) runs `~/.termux/tasker/cmvwifi_nudge`, which issues
`cmd wifi connect-network cmvwifi open` whenever cmvwifi is in scan
results but unassociated. Verify it exists and fires:

```bash
# On the phone (Termux) — history shows 'nudge' lifecycle lines:
tail ~/storage/shared/Tasker/mvwifi_history.log
# Detail log:
cat ~/storage/shared/mvwifi_nudge.log
# Manual test:
su -c 'cmd wifi connect-network cmvwifi open'
```

If the profile is missing, re-import `MVwifiAuto-Termux.prj.xml`.
On an unrooted phone the nudge exits with "no usable root shell";
manual joins or screen-on retries are the fallback.

### Termux plugin times out: "plugin did not respond before timing out, error code 2"

**Problem**: Tasker reports `termux step 1, task: runportalscript
plugin did not respond before timing out. error code 2`, even with
the action timeout raised to 30 seconds.

**Cause**: This is usually **not** a slow script — it means
Termux:Tasker never reported the command's completion back to
Tasker. The most common reason is Android killing the Termux
process mid-execution:

- **Termux is not battery-exempt** — Tasker is typically
  whitelisted but Termux is not, so Android can kill Termux
  while a plugin command is running
- **Phantom process killer enabled** (Android 12+ default) —
  Android kills "phantom" child processes spawned by apps in
  the background. Termux's child processes (bash, python) are
  tracked as phantom processes
- A malformed `service_execute` intent can also crash
  `TermuxService` outright (NullPointerException in
  `TermuxShellUtils.setupProcessArgs`), producing the same
  "plugin did not respond" symptom

**How to tell** (check the log on the phone):

```bash
cat ~/storage/shared/mvwifi_tasker.log
pgrep -af mvwifi    # is the script still alive?
```

The log is overwritten each run and ends with an outcome line
("Run completed successfully" / "Run FAILED"). If the log ends
abruptly mid-request (e.g. urllib3 "Starting new HTTP connection"
lines with no responses) **with no outcome line** and the process
is gone, the process was killed — not just slow. The script's own
HTTP timeouts cap its runtime at roughly 2 minutes worst case, so
a 30s+ plugin timeout with a dead process means the plugin result
was lost.

**Fix**: re-run `./scripts/deploy_android.sh` — it applies all of
the protections below automatically. Or apply them manually:

```bash
adb shell dumpsys deviceidle whitelist +com.termux
adb shell settings put global settings_enable_monitor_phantom_procs false
adb shell pm grant com.termux android.permission.WRITE_SECURE_SETTINGS
```

The last grant lets the wrapper script re-disable the phantom
killer itself on every run (self-heal after OS updates). The
wrapper also holds `termux-wake-lock` during the run.

On rooted phones, `ConnectAndRun` additionally runs a root shell
action (A7) before the plugin call that re-applies all three
protections on every trigger — so a regressed setting is repaired
before it can cause a failure. The action has
continue-task-after-error set, so unrooted phones skip it safely.

Both settings live in `/data` and survive full-image flashes
done without the `-w` wipe flag, but verify them after each
update — or run `./scripts/verify_android.sh` to check the whole
Android-side state at once:

```bash
adb shell dumpsys deviceidle whitelist | grep termux
adb shell settings get global settings_enable_monitor_phantom_procs   # want: false
```

Also exempt Termux via the UI as a belt-and-suspenders measure:
Settings → Apps → Termux → Battery → **Unrestricted**.

### Delay between "Portal handling complete" and working internet

**Problem**: The "Portal handling complete" toast appears but the
phone doesn't show a working WiFi connection for several minutes.

**Cause**: This is normal. After our script accepts the portal
terms, Android runs its own connectivity validation
(`connectivitycheck.gstatic.com/generate_204`) before switching
the default route from cellular to WiFi. Android batches these
checks — 1-3 minutes is normal, especially when cellular data
is active and being preferred.

**Fix**: None needed — this is OS behavior. If faster switchover
is needed, disable cellular data during the run (Tasker Settings
→ Mobile Data toggle) or use `svc data disable` with root, but
both trade convenience for speed.

### HTTP requests timing out with cellular ON

**Problem**: `mvwifi-android --once --verbose` hangs for ~40 seconds
per request and never completes.

**Cause**: Source IP binding alone doesn't bypass Android's policy
routing. The kernel still routes packets over cellular even with the
correct wlan0 source IP.

**Fix**: The code uses `SO_BINDTODEVICE` (socket option 25) for
kernel-level interface binding. This should work from Termux without
root. If it doesn't, verify with:

```bash
python scripts/test_bindtodevice.py
```

If `SO_BINDTODEVICE` reports "PERMISSION DENIED", your device may need
root or `CAP_NET_RAW`.

### "Could not determine IPv4 address for interface 'wlan0'"

**Cause**: The WiFi interface may be `wlan1` on some Pixel devices, or
WiFi isn't connected yet (no IP assigned).

**Fix**: The script auto-detects the interface. If that fails, find it
manually:

```bash
python scripts/detect_interface.py
```

Note: `ip addr` does not work from Termux (Android blocks netlink
sockets). The ioctl-based detection in the script works fine.

### `ip addr` returns "cannot bind netlink socket permission denied"

**Cause**: Android blocks netlink sockets for non-system apps. This is
expected — Termux cannot use `ip addr`.

**Fix**: Use the ioctl-based detection instead. The diagnostic script
`scripts/detect_interface.py` uses `SIOCGIFADDR` ioctl which works from
Termux.

### Debugging on the phone

Write logs to a file for transfer:

```bash
# To Termux home (no permissions needed)
mvwifi-android --once --verbose --log-file ~/mvwifi.log

# To shared storage (requires termux-setup-storage first)
mvwifi-android --once --verbose --log-file ~/storage/shared/mvwifi.log
```

The log file is **overwritten on each run** — it always shows the
most recent run. Its last line records the outcome ("Run completed
successfully" or "Run FAILED"); a log that ends mid-run with no
outcome line means the process was killed.

The Tasker wrapper script writes to
`~/storage/shared/mvwifi_tasker.log` by default.

Transfer via `adb pull`, Google Drive, or `cat` and copy from the
Termux screen.
